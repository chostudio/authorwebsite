            <p>A clever student finds himself admitted into a prestigious academy for elemental powers. There’s only one
                problem: Zapp has no idea how to unlock his power. He’ll have to rely on his wits to survive in the
                BadgeBattle,
                an annual schoolwide battle royale match where the top students compete for a coveted prize. With a
                fighting
                tournament in lieu of finals, a campus filled with secret passageways, and a graduation requirement of
                defeating
                a professor from each of the four Elemental Houses, Elementum Academy is a one-of-a-kind institution.
                But
                when
                Zapp uncovers a dark secret that threatens to overthrow the academy, he’ll have to ask himself what it
                really
                means to have powers.</p>
